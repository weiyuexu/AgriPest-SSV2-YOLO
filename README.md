# Validation data
Images of 172 (20%) were selected from dataset-860 as the validation data in our paper. You can find detection results using SSV2-YOLO model here. 

# Evaluation metrics
The code of evaluation matrics in our paper was illustrated here, including mAP, Precision, Recall, and speed (FPS).

# Video of pest detection platform based on SSV2-YOLO model
A software of sugarcane aphid image/video detection was built. You can find the DEMO video here.
